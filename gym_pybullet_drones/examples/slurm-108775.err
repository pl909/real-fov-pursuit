/home/pl217/miniconda3/envs/drones/lib/python3.10/site-packages/stable_baselines3/common/policies.py:486: UserWarning: As shared layers in the mlp_extractor are removed since SB3 v1.8.0, you should now pass directly a dictionary and not a list (net_arch=dict(pi=..., vf=...) instead of net_arch=[dict(pi=..., vf=...)])

/home/pl217/miniconda3/envs/drones/lib/python3.10/site-packages/stable_baselines3/common/on_policy_algorithm.py:150: UserWarning: You are trying to run PPO on the GPU, but it is primarily intended to run on the CPU when not using a CNN policy (you are using ActorCriticPolicy which should be a MlpPolicy). See https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/issues/1245 for more info. You can pass `device='cpu'` or `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=` to force using the CPU.Note: The model will train, but the GPU utilization will be poor and the training might take longer than on CPU.
