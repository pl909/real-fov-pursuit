/home/pl217/miniconda3/envs/drones/lib/python3.10/site-packages/stable_baselines3/common/on_policy_algorithm.py:150: UserWarning: You are trying to run PPO on the GPU, but it is primarily intended to run on the CPU when not using a CNN policy (you are using ActorCriticPolicy which should be a MlpPolicy). See https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/issues/1245 for more info. You can pass `device='cpu'` or `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=` to force using the CPU.Note: The model will train, but the GPU utilization will be poor and the training might take longer than on CPU.

This may result in reporting modified episode lengths and rewards, if other wrappers happen to modify these. Consider wrapping environment first with ``Monitor`` wrapper.
